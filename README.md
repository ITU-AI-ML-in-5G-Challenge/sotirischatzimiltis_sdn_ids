### Intrusion and Vulnerability Detection in Software Defined Networks
Problem stated by [ITU AI For Good Global Summit](https://challenge.aiforgood.itu.int/match/matchitem/81) and presented by [ITU & ULAK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgne_H0Ki7M)
#### Abstract:
Software Defined Networks (SDNs) have revolutionised the way modern networks are managed and orchestrated. This sophisticated infrastructure can provide numerous benefits but at the same time introduce several security challenges. A centralised controller holds the responsibility of managing the network traffic, thus making it an attractive target to attackers. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) play a crucial role in identifying and addressing security threats within the SDN. By utilising machine learning algorithms an anomaly based detection system was established to identify deviation in network behaviour. Five machine learning algorithms were employed to train the SDN-IDS, and ultimately, the most appropriate one was chosen. The SDN-IDS demonstrated an exceptional overall performance, particularly when using the XGBoost Classifier trained with a reduced feature train dataset, reaching 99.9\% accuracy as well as 99.9 F1-score. Furthermore, it exhibited near-perfect performance in identifying the most types of attacks within the traffic data.

####  Software Defined Network Intrusion Detection System (SDN-IDS) Architecture:
Our SDN-IDS utilises a 4-step approach. Firstly the data are pre-processed (cleaned,encoded,normalised), then are resampled when necessary. Different ML models are trained and finally every ML model is evaluated in order to obtain the best one. 
#### About Machine Learning Models Used:
Three baseline models were chosen to be used among with the some more complex models. Decision Trees (DT), Random Forest (RF) and K-Nearest Neighbours (K-NN) were selected
since they have an extensive use in the topic of IDS, are easy to implement and support multi-class classification. Also a Bagging and a Boosting classifier were utilised. 

#### About Resampling Techniques:
Network traffic datasets used for IDS are usually imbalanced. Imbalanced data usually lead to a biased model towards the majority class. 
From our perspective to tackle this problem, resampling techniques such as SMOTE and Tomekâ€™s link  were utilised in order to alleviate data imbalances between classes.

#### Results
 It can be observed that different combination result in better macro performance where different combination results in better weighted performance. XGBoost
model trained with the reduced baseline dataset achieved an accuracy of 99.9% and an F1 score of 99.9 as well. On the other hand the DT model trained with the reduced feature resampled dataset had an accuracy of 87.77% and an F1 score of 87.20.

The confusion matrices reveal that the XGBoost model faces challenges when classifying the three web attacks and the Infiltration attack. On the other hand, the DT model
exhibits a slight improvement in classifying these attacks but at the cost of a slight decrease in normal traffic classification performance.
